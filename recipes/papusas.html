    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Growing up in a small town in El Salvador, pupusas were the heartbeat of our family meals. As a child, I would eagerly gather around the kitchen, mesmerized by the artistry of my grandmother as she effortlessly shaped the masa dough into perfect circles and filled them with a medley of ingredients. The tantalizing aroma filled the air, and the sizzle on the griddle signaled that something magical was about to happen. The table would be set with vibrant curtido, a tangy pickled cabbage slaw, and a fiery red salsa roja. We would gather, hungry and excited, as my grandmother served us plate after plate of piping hot pupusas, each one bursting with flavors and love.</p>
    <p>Those childhood memories of devouring pupusas linger with me to this day. They were moments of pure joy and connection, as we would sit together, sharing stories, laughter, and the simple pleasure of good food. Pupusas became more than just a meal; they were a symbol of our heritage, a reminder of the traditions and bonds that held our family together. From the traditional revuelta with its melty cheese and savory fillings, to the vegetarian loroco and cheese option, each bite carried a piece of our cultural identity.</p>
    <p>To this day, whenever I bite into a pupusa, I am transported back to the warmth of my grandmother's kitchen, surrounded by love and the comforting flavors of my childhood. The taste of masa, the blend of fillings, and the tang of curtido evoke a sense of belonging and remind me of the power of food to nourish not just our bodies, but also our souls. Pupusas have become a part of who I am, a culinary link to my roots, and a reminder to cherish the traditions and connections that make us who we are.</p>

        <li>Masa harina (corn flour)</li>
        <li>Warm water</li>

        <li>Fillings of your choice (e.g., cheese, refried beans, seasoned pork, loroco, etc.)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine masa harina, warm water, and salt. Mix until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into balls.</li>
        <li>Flatten each ball with your hands to create a small disc, then place your desired filling in the center.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the edges of the disc over the filling, sealing it well. Pat and shape the pupusa into a thick, round disk.</li>
        <li>Preheat a griddle or skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the pupusas on the heated griddle and cook them for a few minutes on each side until they develop a golden-brown crust.</li>
        <li>Remove the pupusas from the griddle and serve them hot with curtido and salsa roja on the side.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the warm, comforting flavors of pupusas with your loved ones, savoring each bite and celebrating the rich culture they represent.</li>
