    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make lasagna, start by preheating your oven to the desired temperature. In a large skillet, cook ground meat (such as beef, turkey, or a combination) with diced onions and minced garlic until browned. Drain excess fat and add tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Simmer the meat sauce while preparing the other components. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Now it's time to layer the lasagna: start with a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of uncooked lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, and a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with a generous amount of mozzarella cheese on top. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the oven until the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove the foil and bake for a few more minutes to achieve a golden crust. Allow the lasagna to rest for a few minutes before serving, allowing the flavors to meld together. Slice and serve this comforting and hearty Italian dish to enjoy its delicious layers.</p>
